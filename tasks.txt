Great! Preparing for the **GitHub Actions (GH200) Certification** is a smart move, and learning by doing is the best way to get there. To help you master GitHub Actions, I'll provide a **structured set of hands-on exercises** covering all the key concepts—from beginner to advanced—aligned with topics you’ll need for the **GH200** exam.

---

## 🏁 **What You’ll Learn (Topics Covered)**

These exercises will cover:

1. **Workflow fundamentals**
2. **Triggers (events)**
3. **Jobs and steps**
4. **Actions (composite, Docker, JavaScript)**
5. **Context and expressions**
6. **Secrets and environment variables**
7. **Matrix builds**
8. **Caching and artifacts**
9. **Reusable workflows**
10. **Security and best practices**
11. **Workflow concurrency and conditions**
12. **Environment protection rules**
13. **Deployment strategies (manual approvals, environments)**
14. **Self-hosted runners**
15. **Debugging workflows**

# 📘 Learning Plan and Exercises

Each level builds on the previous one.

---

## 🧩 **Level 1: Basics and Core Concepts**

### ✅ Exercise 1: Hello GitHub Actions

* Create a `.github/workflows/hello.yml`
* Trigger: `on: push`
* Action: Print `Hello GitHub Actions!` using `run: echo`

### ✅ Exercise 2: Run on Multiple Events

* Trigger workflow on both `push` and `pull_request`
* Print event name using `${{ github.event_name }}`

### ✅ Exercise 3: Use a Marketplace Action

* Use the `actions/checkout@v4` and `actions/setup-node@v4`
* Print the current Node.js version

---

## ⚙️ **Level 2: Jobs, Steps, and Contexts**

### ✅ Exercise 4: Multiple Jobs

* Create two jobs: `build` and `test`
* `test` depends on `build`

### ✅ Exercise 5: Use Environment Variables

* Define custom and built-in environment variables
* Print them with `echo`

### ✅ Exercise 6: Expressions & Contexts

* Use expressions to control step execution
* Example: only run a step if `github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`

---

## 🧪 **Level 3: Testing and Matrix Builds**

### ✅ Exercise 7: Matrix Strategy

* Test a Node.js app on multiple versions (e.g., 16, 18, 20)
* Use `strategy.matrix` to define versions

### ✅ Exercise 8: Conditional Execution

* Run certain jobs/steps only on `main` or on `tag` pushes

---

## 📦 **Level 4: Artifacts, Caching and Reuse**

### ✅ Exercise 9: Cache Dependencies

* Use `actions/cache` to cache `node_modules`

### ✅ Exercise 10: Upload/Download Artifacts

* Build an artifact (e.g., a ZIP file) and upload it in one job
* Download it in a later job for testing

### ✅ Exercise 11: Reusable Workflows

* Create a reusable workflow
* Call it from another workflow using `workflow_call`

---

## 🔒 **Level 5: Secrets and Security**

### ✅ Exercise 12: Using Secrets

* Store a GitHub secret (e.g., API key)
* Access it in a step with `secrets.MY_SECRET`

### ✅ Exercise 13: Mask Output and Logs

* Use `::add-mask::` to mask sensitive output

### ✅ Exercise 14: Protected Environments

* Create an environment with required reviewers
* Add a deployment job to it

---

## 🚀 **Level 6: Deployment and Advanced Patterns**

### ✅ Exercise 15: Manual Approval

* Add `environment` with `deployment_protection_rules`
* Require manual approval before deployment

### ✅ Exercise 16: Dynamic Workflow Dispatch Inputs

* Use `workflow_dispatch` with `inputs`
* Print the inputs in the workflow

---

## 🧱 **Level 7: Custom Actions and Runners**

### ✅ Exercise 17: Create a Composite Action

* Build a composite action with multiple steps
* Use it in a workflow

### ✅ Exercise 18: Use a Docker Action

* Use an existing Docker-based action (or write your own)

### ✅ Exercise 19: Self-hosted Runners

* Set up a self-hosted runner (optional but important)
* Run a workflow on this runner

---

## 🪲 **Level 8: Debugging and Concurrency**

### ✅ Exercise 20: Enable Debug Logging

* Set `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG` to true
* Inspect logs

### ✅ Exercise 21: Concurrency

* Add `concurrency` to prevent overlapping runs on same branch

---

## 📝 Final Challenge (Capstone)

### ✅ Exercise 22: Full CI/CD Pipeline

* Build a Node.js app (or other language)
* Steps:

  1. Lint code
  2. Run tests
  3. Build and package
  4. Upload artifacts
  5. Require approval for deployment
  6. Deploy to `production` environment (dummy step is fine)
* Use matrix, caching, secrets, reusable workflows, and concurrency
